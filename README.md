Analyzing BlackRock's stock trends using BigQuery SQL: SMA crossovers, volatility, and trading patterns
This project used BigQuery SQL to analyze BLK's stock for trading signals, price trends, volatility and weekly patterns in price/volume. 
By the end, we found contradictory signals: Death crosses (bearish) had higher returns than Golden crosses (bullish); revealed Friday surges: highest volume/prices occured on the end of weekday, while the lowest being on Wednesday. Additionally we spotted unstable periods through calculation of daily volatility.
